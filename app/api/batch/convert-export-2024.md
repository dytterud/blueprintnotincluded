# OniExtract2024 import — export contract & converter reference

Reference for `convert-export-2024.ts` (`npm run import:2024`). Covers what a game
export must provide, what the converter produces, and the contract the export side
must honour so re-exports don't silently break rendering.

Game version baseline: **U59-744825-SCRPAN** (Spaced Out DLC), export dated 2026-07-30.

## Pipeline

```
npm run import:2024            # regenerate DB + assets from ./export
npm run import:2024:dry-run    # validate + report counts, write/copy nothing
# convert:2024 is a kept alias for import:2024
```

Steps:
1. Read `export/database/*.json`, map to the website's consolidated shape (field
   renames, `viewMode` hash → overlay, flat-icon model, build menu).
2. Write `database-2024.json` into **both** asset roots (backend `assets/database/` +
   `frontend/src/assets/database/`). The loose JSON is the only committed runtime DB
   artifact (readable diffs). The backend reads it directly at startup; the frontend
   zips it into the gitignored `database-2024.zip` it fetches, via its `prebuild`/
   `prestart` (`frontend/scripts/build-database-zip.js`). The converter emits no `.zip`.
3. Detect connectables (a `connection_sprites/<prefabId>/` dir exists) and **measure**
   each one's render scale from its `15.png`.
4. Mirror `ui_image/` and `connection_sprites/` into both asset roots **content-aware**:
   a file is rewritten only when it actually changed, only removed files are pruned, so
   unchanged icons keep their mtime (no churn). The export is **not byte-deterministic**
   across game updates — Klei re-rasterizes untouched art, spraying sub-pixel anti-aliasing
   jitter along icon edges — so a byte-different PNG is additionally compared *perceptually*
   (`pngVisuallyEqual`: alpha-premultiply → 2-pass Gaussian blur → count pixels still
   differing by more than a threshold) and **preserved** when visually identical. The blur
   is what separates genuine redraws from re-rasterization jitter even on densely-textured
   sprites (doors, gas blobs), where a raw pixel count cannot. Sync logs report the preserved
   count as `preserved N re-encoded`. `ui_image_facade/` is skipped (unused; one-line flip
   near the top of the converter to enable).
5. Flatten `database/po_string.json` into `frontend/src/assets/strings/strings.json` —
   the English game-string map the website resolves display names against (element,
   building, category names + overlay labels). Keys are prefixed with `STRINGS.` to match
   what the frontend's `GameStringService` queries; values keep their `<link=…>` markup,
   which the service strips at load. Frontend-only (strings aren't used server-side).
   **Without this step, freshly added elements render their raw `<link=…>` markup in the
   build menu** (the lookup misses and falls back to the raw DB name).
6. Validate; exit non-zero on an incomplete import (missing icon, a connection dir
   missing one of `0–15`, a connectable that's neither tile nor utility, `po_string.json`
   absent, etc.).

Re-running on the same export is a near no-op: the JSON and every sprite are written
only when their content actually changed. The export encoder is deterministic, so
unchanged pixels stay byte-identical and git shows only genuine changes.

## What the export ships / what we read

| Export provides | We use it for |
|---|---|
| `database/*.json` (13 files) | building/element data — we read `building.json`, `elements.json`, `uiSpriteInfo.json`, `po_string.json`, plus `geyser.json` + `entities.json` for the terrain catalogue |
| `ui_image_rects.json` (export **root**) | flat-icon placement rects by prefab id — the only delivery path for terrain features' rects (see below) |
| `ui_image/<prefabId>.png` | the single flat icon per building (1,241 files) |
| `connection_sprites/<prefabId>/<0..15>.png` | the 16 tiling states for connectables |
| `ui_image_facade/` | nothing today (not copied) |

Current output (487 buildings): 212 elements, 402 build-menu items, 15 categories,
512 uiSprites (487 building icons + 17 injected element/info overlays + 8 utility-port
indicators registered from the export's `ui_image/` PNGs), 33 connectables, 322 buildings
with utility ports.

## Image model — two kinds, used differently

**1. `ui_image/` flat icons (one per building).** Shown in the build/select menu and as
the picture of a placed non-tiling building. The renderer maps each icon onto the
building's footprint box (1 cell = 100 px on screen). With no placement data it would
*stretch to fill* the footprint, which only looks right when the icon's opaque content
equals the footprint. Tight-cropped animation renders overhang the footprint, so they
need `uiImageRect` (below).

**2. `connection_sprites/<prefabId>/0..15.png` (16 states of a connectable).** Wires,
pipes, rails, tiles. The editor picks one of 16 by neighbour bitmask
(`left=1, right=2, up=4, down=8`; `15.png` = connected all four sides — identical to the
website's existing `tileConnections`/wire convention, no remap). The build/select menu
still uses the single canonical icon; only placed-item rendering uses the 16 states.

## Contract — don't break these (everything else, incl. resolution, can change freely)

The pipeline is **resolution-independent**: ship bigger/sharper images and nothing needs
to change. Icons downscale to the footprint; connection sprites are rendered at a measured
ratio (see below). What breaks rendering is changing **framing**, not pixel count.

1. **Icon naming:** `ui_image/<prefabId>.png`, filename == `building.json` `name` (the
   prefab tag, e.g. `FabricatedWood.png` — **not** the display name). Verified 1241/1241
   match by key.
2. **`uiImageRect`** (per building, cells, footprint-relative): required for any icon whose
   art overhangs its footprint; see next section. Currently emitted for 342/487 buildings
   and all 31 terrain features; the other 145 buildings fall back to stretch-to-footprint.
   **Every rect must match its own PNG's pixel aspect** — the import fails otherwise.
3. **Connection sprites:** all 16 of `0–15` present, bitmask `left=1/right=2/up=4/down=8`.
4. **Connectable signal:** the `connection_sprites/<prefabId>/` directory exists
   (`building.json` carries no `tileableLeftRight/tileableTopBottom`).
5. **Connection-sprite geometry** (so the measured scale stays correct):
   - All 16 states share **one canvas size** and **one cell registration** (same centre,
     same pixels-per-cell). Scale them up together.
   - In `15.png` the opaque pixels equal **exactly one cell, centred**. Overhang/caps on
     *disconnected* sides in other states is fine and expected. `15.png` is our measuring
     stick; if it gains overhang or goes off-centre our scale goes wrong.
6. **Building fields we read** keep their names/shapes: `name`, `nameString`,
   `isFoundation`, `isKAnimTile`, `isUtility`, `widthInCells`, `heightInCells`,
   `sceneLayer`, `objectLayer`, `viewMode`, `permittedRotations`, `dragBuild`,
   `buildLocationRule`, `materialCategory`, `materialMass`, `utilities`; plus top-level
   `bBuildingDefList`, `buildMenuCategories`, `buildingAndSubcategoryDataPairs`. Adding
   fields is safe.
7. **`utilities[].type`** values stay the `ConnectionType` enum *member name* (string,
   e.g. `"GasInput"`, `"LogicReset"`) and `utilities[].offset` stays in the game's
   CellOffset convention; see "Utility connection ports" below.

We inject 17 element-tile / info overlay sprites of our own (`element_tile_back`,
`*_tile_front`, `info_back`, `info_front_0..11`) — **don't** provide these. The 8
utility-port indicators, by contrast, now come from the export: ship them as
`ui_image/<name>.png` (see "Utility connection ports" below).

## `uiImageRect` — flat-icon placement

Per building, the rendered PNG's rectangle **in cell units, relative to the footprint**.
Omit it to mean "image == footprint" (legacy stretch-to-footprint fallback).

```jsonc
// on each building.json bBuildingDefList[] entry
"uiImageRect": { "x": 0, "y": -1.24, "w": 5, "h": 4.24 }
```

- Footprint occupies `(0,0)` bottom-left to `(widthInCells, heightInCells)` top-right.
  `+x` right, `+y` **up**. Units = cells, **real numbers** (do not round).
- `x, y` = bottom-left corner of the **image**; `w, h` = image size in cells. The rect
  describes the whole PNG, mapped linearly, so its pixel aspect must equal `w:h`.
- Overhang = going outside the footprint: `y` negative ⇒ art hangs below (e.g. a steam
  turbine's exhaust); `x+w > widthInCells` ⇒ extends right; etc.

Compute (export side), with `ppc` = render pixels-per-cell, origin at footprint bottom-left:

```
w = imgPxW / ppc
h = imgPxH / ppc
x = (artLeft   - footprintLeft)   / cellSize
y = (artBottom - footprintBottom) / cellSize   // flip sign if computed in image space (+y down)
```

This is the same information the 2020/2023 atlas carried as `pivot` + `realSize`. The
converter passes it through and the renderer draws into the rect (unit-tested in
`__tests__/lib/draw-part-placement.test.ts`); buildings without it keep the old behaviour
so nothing regresses mid-rollout. The import log prints
`buildings with uiImageRect placement: N / 487`.

### Two delivery paths

Buildings carry their rect on their `building.json` `bBuildingDefList[]` entry. **Terrain
features cannot** — they are not `BuildingDef`s, so they have no entry there at all. Their
rects arrive instead via `ui_image_rects.json` at the export root: a flat
`prefabId → {x,y,w,h}` map, same units and semantics, covering buildings redundantly (it is
byte-identical to their `building.json` rects) and terrain features exclusively. The
converter reads it only for the terrain catalogue, so there is one source per consumer and
no chance of the two disagreeing about a building.

### The aspect invariant — checked every import

A rect is a claim about a specific image: the PNG maps *linearly* onto it, so `w:h` must
equal the PNG's pixel aspect. When they disagree the icon draws at the wrong size **and**
the wrong offset, silently, for every placement on the site.

That is not hypothetical. The exporter had two passes that both wrote `ui_image/<id>.png` —
a main-menu pass emitting the kanim's authored `ui` atlas sub-rect, and an in-game pass
rendering at ~200 px/cell and measuring the rect from that render. Rects persisted across
runs, images did not, so a main-menu pass after an in-game pass replaced renders with atlas
icons and left the rects describing images no longer on disk. At its worst that affected
302 of 342 buildings on the export side. The exporter now skips prefabs that already have a
measured rect, and runs the check itself at the end of each in-game pass.

The importer checks it too, over what it is about to emit rather than over
`ui_image_rects.json` — buildings source their rects from `building.json`, which is the file
that actually went stale:

```text
for every emitted rect:  |(w/h) - (pngW/pngH)| / (pngW/pngH)  <  0.02
```

Logged as `uiImageRect aspect mismatches: N / M`; a non-zero N fails the import. The 2%
tolerance absorbs the exporter's rounding to 3 decimals. `__tests__/asset-processing/
database-validation.test.ts` asserts the same invariant over the *committed* database, so a
bad import cannot be merged even if someone ignores the exit code.

### Terrain features

The 31 geysers, vents, volcanoes and the oil reservoir ship tight-cropped ~200 px/cell
renders (`GeyserGeneric_big_volcano.png` is 693×725 for a 3×3 footprint), so the stretch
fallback is a visible regression for them rather than a graceful default: the art lands
roughly half a cell low and ~15% small, with the plume overhang cropped away. Every
catalogue entry therefore carries `uiImageRect`, and a test fails if one does not.

## Connection-sprite scale (measured, not assumed)

Connection PNGs frame one cell plus optional cap/overhang, so a PNG's canvas is not
necessarily one cell, and the factor varies per building **and** per export framing (an
early export measured tiles at ~1.5×, a later one tightened to ~1.0×). The converter
therefore measures scale per building from the `15.png` alpha bbox (`canvas px ÷ cell px`)
and stores `connectionScale {x,y}` in the DB; the renderer draws connection parts
centre-anchored at `100 × connectionScale`. Re-measured every import, so it auto-adapts to
new framing/resolution. No mod/export change needed.

## Utility connection ports (plumbing / power / automation / shipping indicators)

Each building carries `utilities[]` — the input/output ports the editor draws as little
markers when you switch to the matching overlay (plumbing, ventilation, power, automation,
shipping). One entry per port:

```jsonc
// building.json bBuildingDefList[].utilities[]
{ "offset": { "x": -1, "y": 0 }, "type": "GasInput", "isSecondary": false }
```

- **`type`** — the `ConnectionType` enum **member name** as a string (added in U59;
  earlier exports used the int). The converter maps it to the int via
  `CONNECTION_TYPE_BY_NAME` (`PowerInput=0 … LogicRibbonOutput=14`). `NONE` and
  `LogicControlInput` never appear; MUX/DEMUX selector ports come through as plain
  `LogicInput`. An unrecognised name is dropped and counted in the import report
  (`unknown connection types: N`), which also fails the import.
- **`offset`** — cell offset, **pre-rotation, y-up, footprint-relative**. This is the
  game's CellOffset convention and it matches the website's internal coordinates **exactly**
  (verified field-by-field against the pre-2024 DB — LiquidPump/GasFilter/LogicGateAND/etc.
  all identical), so the converter passes offsets through with **no transform**. The
  renderer (`BlueprintItem.drawPixiUtility`) draws each marker at this offset and rotates it
  with the building.
- **`isSecondary`** — true for a building's second port of one conduit type (filter bypass
  output, overflow-valve overflow outlet). The renderer tints these orange (`0xFBB03B`)
  instead of white/green. U59 sets it reliably; earlier exports did not.

**Synthesized power-bridge ports (workaround for an export gap).** The U59 export ships the
power/wire bridges with an **empty** `utilities[]`, even though every other conduit bridge
emits `Input(-1,0)`+`Output(1,0)` (gas/liquid/solid/logic all do, verified). With no ports the
editor draws no connection markers for them. The converter fills the gap for the three 3×1
standard wire bridges — `WireBridge`, `WireRefinedBridge`, `WireRubberBridge` — synthesizing
`PowerInput(-1,0)`+`PowerOutput(1,0)` (`SYNTHESIZED_BRIDGE_PORTS`), the exact offsets the 3×1
conduit bridges use. It fills **only an empty array**, so a fixed future export takes
precedence automatically; the import logs `synthesized power-bridge ports: N`. The two 1×1
HighWattage bridges (`WireBridgeHighWattage`, `WireRefinedBridgeHighWattage`) are **not**
covered — their port geometry isn't derivable from this export. The real fix is export-side
(see "Open items").

**Indicator sprites.** The markers themselves (`input`, `output`,
`electrical_disconnected`, `logicInput`, `logicOutput`, `logicResetUpdate`,
`logic_ribbon_all_in`, `logic_ribbon_all_out`) are resolved by id in
`ConnectionHelper.getConnectionSprite` (tint applied at draw time, no spriteModifier). Since
U59 the export ships each as its own flat PNG in `ui_image/<name>.png`, so the converter
registers all 8 as whole-image sprites (`uvMin 0,0`, `uvSize` = the PNG's real size) and
copies the PNGs into the SpriteInfo image root (`frontend/src/assets/images/`) — `SpriteInfo`
resolves `textureName` there, not under `ui_image/`. `drawPixiUtility` forces a fixed
0.5×0.5-cell draw size, so the icons render the same regardless of PNG resolution. The import
fails (`utility indicator PNGs missing: N`) if the export drops any of the 8. This replaces
the old approach of slicing the legacy packed-atlas pages (`hat_role_building1`,
`1bed_1toilet_locked`, `action_follow_cam`, `all_artifacts_locked`, `Animal_friends_locked`);
nothing references those pages anymore.

## `viewMode` mapping

`building.json` `viewMode` is the game-native overlay **name** (e.g. `"Power"`,
`"GasConduit"`, `"Logic"`) or `null` when the building has no special overlay. (U59 changed
this from the old Klei `HashedString` hex; the converter no longer parses hex.) The names are
mapped to the `Overlay` enum in `VIEW_MODE_TO_OVERLAY` at the top of the converter (Power,
LiquidConduit→Liquid, GasConduit→Gas, Logic→Automation, SolidConveyor→Conveyor, Oxygen,
Temperature, Decor, Light, Rooms→Room, Radiation/Disease/Crop→Unknown); `null`/`""`→Base. An
unrecognised name is counted in the import report (`unknown viewMode names: N`) and fails the
import.

## Schema-vs-actual caveats

`EXPORT_SCHEMA.md` (in the export) is idealized in places; the converter handles the real
data:
- `viewMode` shown as a name (`"Default"`); real export is a hex hash.
- Image filenames documented by display name; reality is prefab key.
- `uiSpriteName` shown populated; actually `null` for all 449 buildings.
- `kPrefabID.tags` / `requiredDlcIds` can be a space-separated **string** OR an array.
- Element `state` is inconsistent: the enum *name* (`"Solid"`) for most solids, its raw
  numeric value as a string (`"5"`, `"6"`, `"20"`) for everything else — and the numeric
  form carries flag bits above the phase. `parseElementState()` accepts either and masks
  to the low 2 bits, giving the `ElementState` enum (Vacuum/Gas/Liquid/Solid).

## Element mass and temperature defaults

`elements.json` carries the load-time constants the game seeds its own mass/temperature
pickers with, so the website no longer applies one hardcoded default to every element:

| field                | unit   | notes                                          |
| -------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `maxMass`            | kg     | sim cell capacity                              |
| `defaultMass`        | kg     | what the game pre-fills                        |
| `defaultTemperature` | Kelvin | same scale as `lowTemp` / `highTemp`           |
| `lowTemp`/`highTemp` | Kelvin | phase-change bounds, used as the picker's range |

These are independent values, not derivable from each other: Crude Oil defaults to 350 K
inside a 233–673 K range, and Chlorine defaults to 600 kg against a 1000 kg capacity.

Gases are the reason this can't be a static table. `gas.yaml` ships without `maxMass`,
`defaultMass` or `highTemp`; `ElementLoader.CopyEntryToElement` applies `maxMass = 1.8`,
`defaultMass = 1.0` and `highTemp = defaultTemperature + 100` at load time. The converter
asserts both halves of that contract and fails the import on either:

- every gas has `maxMass == 1.8` and `defaultMass == 1.0` — a violation means the exporter
  read the YAML instead of the runtime `Element`, and every gas mass picker is wrong;
- `defaultMass <= maxMass` for every element, which the game enforces itself in
  `ElementLoader.CheckElements()`.

Current export: 32 gas, 52 liquid, 125 solid, 3 vacuum.

## Unused export files (future capabilities, not wired up)

7 of 13 JSONs are intentionally unread today; the schema unblocks them if/when we add
the capability: `items` (eggs/seeds/suits), `food`, `recipe`, `multiEntities` (space POIs),
`tags`, `attribute`, `db` (duplicant DB, ~20 MB, case-sensitive parse). `geyser` and
`entities` are read, but only for the terrain-feature catalogue — the rest of `entities`
(critters/plants) is still unused. `ui_image_facade/` (988 files) is also unused. `po_string`
is read (English game strings → `strings.json`); the site is English-only, so the legacy
per-locale `.po` files have been retired — non-English i18n would need translated sources.

## Rendering model — how the site uses the converted data

Rendering uses the 2024 flat-icon model, not the retired multi-sprite atlas.

- **Types**: `lib/src/b-export/b-export-2024.ts` — raw 2024 export shapes (13 files).
- **Import**: `convert-export-2024.ts` (`npm run import:2024`) → consolidated
  `database-2024.json` written to both asset roots (committed; the `.zip` is a gitignored
  build derivative); content-aware syncs `ui_image/` (1,241 flat PNGs) and
  `connection_sprites/` into both asset roots.
- **Render**: each building is one flat icon — `OniItem.flatIconId`, `DrawPart.flatIconId`,
  no UV slice. `uiImageRect` (when present) places overhanging art relative to the
  footprint; otherwise the icon is stretched to the footprint.
- **Connectables** (31 prefabs): render `connection_sprites/{prefabId}/{bitmask}.png` per
  4-bit neighbour mask (left=1, right=2, up=4, down=8). `OniItem.connectionSprites` is
  derived from dir presence; `BlueprintItem` builds 16 tagged flat-icon draw-parts;
  per-building `connectionScale` is measured from `15.png` at import time. The build/select
  menu keeps the single canonical icon (`iconUrl`).
- **Utility ports** (275/449 buildings): `BBuildingDef2024.utilities[]` carries each
  input/output port as `{offset, type, isSecondary}`. The U59 export emits `type` as the
  `ConnectionType` enum _name_ (string); the converter maps it to the int via
  `CONNECTION_TYPE_BY_NAME`. Offsets are pre-rotation/y-up/footprint-relative and already
  match the website's internal convention (no transform). `BlueprintItem.drawPixiUtility`
  draws the markers per overlay; the 8 indicator sprites (`input`/`output`/`logicInput`…)
  are registered from the export's own `ui_image/<name>.png` flats (copied into
  `frontend/src/assets/images/` at import) — they no longer slice the legacy atlas pages.
- **Loaders**: backend reads `database-2024.json` directly; frontend fetches
  `database-2024.zip` (regenerated from the committed JSON by its `prebuild`/`prestart`).
- **DLC data**: each building record now includes `dlcIds: string[]` (e.g. `['EXPANSION1_ID']`
  for Spaced Out buildings). The converter (`import:2024`) populates this from the raw export's
  `kPrefabID.requiredDlcIds`. Used by `BlueprintAnalyzer` to derive metadata.

## Open items to the export side

- **Power-bridge `utilities[]`:** the wire bridges ship an empty `utilities[]` while every
  other conduit bridge emits `Input(-1,0)`+`Output(1,0)`. Emit the power ports for
  `WireBridge`/`WireRefinedBridge`/`WireRubberBridge` (and the 1×1 `*HighWattage` bridges,
  whose offsets we can't derive) so the converter's `SYNTHESIZED_BRIDGE_PORTS` workaround can
  be removed.
- **`uiImageRect` rollout:** emit it for the remaining buildings whose art deviates
  from the footprint (145 have none today; the rest can omit it).
- **`ui_image_facade/`:** drop it to shrink the handoff, or tell us what it's for.
- **Higher-res `ui_image`:** one test asserts each flat-icon PNG is < 5 MB — flag ahead of
  time if any icon will exceed that.
- **Other unread JSONs:** trim if not coming, or confirm they're for future work.
